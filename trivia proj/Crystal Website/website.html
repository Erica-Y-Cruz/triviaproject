	Hi there! I am 23 years old, and I am a computer science major with a minor in math. This is my last year of college. I will be graduating in May 2022. I chose this major because I was influenced by my father who taught himself how to program, although he majored in mechanical engineering while he was in school. I have taken an interest in web development, and cannot wait to learn more, as I have a few people who would like me to build websites for them in the future. HTML5 has been an interesting language to learn thus far, it is different from other programming languages Iâ€™ve learned. I would like to learn more programming languages related to web development to increase mt knowledge. I also enjoy learning Python and Java. Besides programming, I also enjoy learning about different cultures and languages. I am currently teaching myself French and brushing up on my American sign language skills that I learned in high school. I hope to travel to France next year and utilize what French I will know by then, and hopefully travel to surrounding countries afterwards. It will be my graduation present from my parents. I love finding new restaurants to eat at, so below is a link to Foursquare! </p>
